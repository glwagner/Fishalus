`dedaLES`_: Large Eddy Simulation with `dedalus`_
=================================================

`dedaLES`_ provides solvers for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using 
the `dedalus`_ framework for solving partial differential equations 
with spectral methods.

`dedaLES`_ solvers are implemented as Python classes that encapsulate a specific 
equation set for fluid dynamics --- some flavor of Navier-Stokes --- 
in a specific geometry. The turbulence closures are then provided as classes 
which can be added to any of the fluid model equation sets.
We also provide an API for setting boundary conditions, initial conditions,
and simulating specific types of problems clearly and conveniently.

:ref:`Fluid models`
-------------------

We intend to implement solvers for 

* Rotating, stratified Boussinesq flow in a channel
* Compressible flow
* Homogeneous isotropic turbulence 

all with arbitrary tracer fields.


:ref:`Subgrid closures`
-----------------------

We intend to implement the subgrid turbulent closures:

* Constant Smagorinsky (`Constant Smagorinsky wiki`_)
* Modified Constant Smagorinsky for stratified flow (`Pressel et al 2015`_) 
* Anisotropic minimum dissipation (`Rozema et al 2015`_, `Abkar et al 2016`_, `Vreugdenhil and Taylor 2018`_)
* A second-order closure for boundary layer turbulence (`Sullivan et al 1994`_, `Moeng and Wyngaard 1988`_)
